## Important setup info
Since the data isn't public-facing, go ahead and download the whole 
"2021 Final Project Data" folder into this directory.

Additionally, you'll need to download the folder select_fields from Adair's ubox
and add it to the SonicData directory.

Also, the code assumes you have the project root dir ("turbulence-CFOG-7710") on
your $PYTHONPATH
